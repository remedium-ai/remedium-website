## Introduction

Digital transformation is reshaping perioperative care, enabling precision medicine and improving patient-centered outcomes. From preoperative assessment to postoperative recovery, technology is empowering clinicians to deliver safer, more efficient, and personalized care. This article highlights the most impactful technologies and their applications in perioperative medicine.

## Key Technologies Transforming Perioperative Care

### 1. Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
Integrated EHRs provide perioperative teams with real-time access to comprehensive patient data, supporting informed decision-making and seamless care transitions.

### 2. Telemedicine and Remote Monitoring
Virtual preoperative consultations and remote postoperative monitoring enhance access, reduce complications, and support early intervention for at-risk patients.

### 3. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Predictive Analytics
AI-driven risk assessment tools predict perioperative complications, guide personalized care pathways, and optimize resource allocation.

### 4. Wearable Devices and Mobile Health
Continuous monitoring of vital signs and mobility enables proactive management of recovery and early detection of adverse events.

### 5. Data Analytics for Quality Improvement
Advanced analytics track perioperative outcomes, identify trends, and drive targeted quality improvement initiatives.

## Case Study: Technology-Enabled Perioperative Pathways
A hospital implemented an integrated EHR, AI-based risk prediction, and remote monitoring for surgical patients. The result: a 28% reduction in readmissions, faster recoveries, and higher patient satisfaction scores. Clinicians reported improved workflow efficiency and better interdisciplinary communication.

## Conclusion
Technology is a powerful enabler of precision perioperative care. By embracing digital tools and fostering a culture of innovation, healthcare professionals can achieve superior patient outcomes, operational excellence, and sustainable growth in the evolving landscape of perioperative medicine.
