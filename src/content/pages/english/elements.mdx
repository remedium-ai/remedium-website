    // Set `rel` attribute for external urls or use provided value
    rel: cta_btn.url?.startsWith("http")
      ? cta_btn.rel || "noopener noreferrer"
      : cta_btn.rel || undefined,

    // Set `target` to "_blank" for external urls unless otherwise specified
    target: cta_btn.url?.startsWith("http")
      ? cta_btn.target || "_blank"
      : cta_btn.target || undefined,
  }}
  class="relative flex items-center"
  href={getLocaleUrlCTM(cta_btn.url, Astro.currentLocale)}
>
  <span
    class="btn btn-outline btn-outline-primary has-text-flip-animation"
    data-content={cta_btn.label}
  >
    {cta_btn.label}

  <span class="icon">

      src="/images/icons/svg/arrow-top-right.svg"
    />
  </span>

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more dashes (`---`), asterisks (`***`), or underscores (`___`) on a new line:  
**Example**:

## Headings [.text-h4]

### Heading 3 [.custom-class .another-class]
